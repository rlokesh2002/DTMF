# DTMF
This is a self project done as addendum to an experiment in Digital Signal Processing Laboratory. Dual-tone multi-frequency signalling (DTMF) is a telecommunication signalling system using the voice-frequency band over telephone lines between telephone equipment and other communications devices and switching centres

The aim of the experiment is:
•	Using DTMF technique to encode the keys {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D}.
•	Design a bandpass FIR filter bank and decode the keys from the signal sent and analyze the noise performance and filtering.
• Design a keypad GUI to take the input parameters, key sequence and displays output plots.

Please read the report to get more insight about the working of GUI
